The idea is about moving around a new city in a safe manner, and makes use of the Google Maps API. 

The data from this mapview was used to calculate the safest route using the Google Places API and was integrated into an Android app. 

Safest route provides three options, color coded to show the advised route (Green: Safest, Orange: Moderately Safe, Red: Not recommended)
